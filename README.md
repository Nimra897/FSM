# FSM
I have created a game in which i used ThirdPersonController (NPC) and FirstPersonController (FPS). I created an FSM for NPC. In this game firstly my ethan is in IDLE state. When i started moving my FPS, ethan starts to run and becomes in RUNNING state and i as a FPS starts chasing ethan. Meanwhile Ethan will eat the tablets which will increase his health to +1 and if he collide with hurdle his health will be decremented to -10 and his state changes to DEAD state and when his heatlh becomes 0 his states changes to GAMEOVER and game ends.
